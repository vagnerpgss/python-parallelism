# Python Parallelism
Repository with the codes used in the study and presentation of Movile Tech Talk Python Zoop.
The code presented here may help those who want to learn more about parallel algorithms using the Python modules Threads, Multiprocessing, and asyncIO (Asynchronous I/O).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Requirements

You need Python 3.7 or later to run mypy.  You can have multiple Python versions (2.x and 3.x) installed on the same system without problems.

In Ubuntu, Mint and Debian you can install Python 3 like this:

    $ sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip

I recommend using pyenv (https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation):

A wonderful Python Version Management tool. Previously known as Pythonbrew, pyenv lets you install multiple Python versions, set directory (project)-specific Python versions, and create/manage virtual python environments ("virualenv's"). All this is done on Linux and OS X without depending on Python itself and it works at the user-level, no need for any sudo commands. Even if you already have Python installed on your system, it is worth having pyenv installed so that you can easily try out new language features or help contribute to a project that is on a different version of Python.
